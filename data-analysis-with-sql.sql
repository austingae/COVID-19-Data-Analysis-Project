Project Purpose: To understand the COVID-19 dataset, ask questions and find answers based on the dataset, and find correlations between two variables. 

Structure Of This Project: This SQL project is divided into 3 parts: 1) this part clears up some confusion I had with the dataset. 2) this part asked some general questions with insightful answers of the dataset 3) this part identified whether correlation exist between two variables from the dataset.

/* Question: What percentage of the US population has gotten covid-19,
   been hospitalized for covid-19, died to covid-19, been fully vaccinated compared
   to the population? */
/* Answer:
    In the United States, covid-19 percentage is 30%; hospitalization percentage is 13%, death_percentage is 0.33%, and fully_vaccinated_people percentage is 68% compared to its total population of about 338 million.

-- Question: With the COVID-19 pandemic, has the average global life expectancy from 2020 to 2023 increased or decreased?
-- Answer: Average life expectancy has decreased some decimal points every year. In 2020, average life expectancy was 73.851. In 2023, that number is 73.421.

-- PART 3: Identifying correlations between two variables in the COVID-19 dataset. 

-- Question: Is there a correlation between gdp_per_capita and vaccination_rate? 
-- Answer: Well, sort of. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.59 shows that there is some degree of correlation between the two variables.
SELECT
  CORR(vaccination_rate, gdp_per_capita)
FROM
  (SELECT
    location,

  GROUP BY
    location
  ORDER BY
    3 DESC
  )

-- Question: Is there a correlation between gdp_per_capita and the number of hospital beds per one thousand?
-- Prediction:  There is some degree of correlation -- I would guess about .65. My reasoning is that the richer a country, the more hospital beds it should be able to afford. 
-- Answer: The result is actually surprising -- the correlation_coefficient is 0.29! This means that there is little correlation between the two variables. 
SELECT
  CORR(hospital_beds_per_one_thousand, gdp_per_capita) as correlation_coefficient

  WHERE
    continent IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY
    location
  )

-- Question: Is there a correlation between gdp_per_capita and covid_19_death_rate by country?
-- Prediction: I feel like the Pearson coefficient would be like -0.50. The correlation would be opposite. 
-- Answer: The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.24.
